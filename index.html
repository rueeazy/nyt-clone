                    <p>
                        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
                        with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and 
                        equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
                        <br><br>
                        He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should
                        have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe
                        bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
                        infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe
                        to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                        <br><br>
                        If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole
                        to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles
                        and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like
                        spit in the ocean.
                        <br><br>
                        “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
                        <br><br>
                        On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of
                        the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
                        <br><br>
                        Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South
                        Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
                        detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe
                        being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second
                        old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, 
                        that Dr. Guth was correct.

                        "Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether
                        it could ever be proved.
                        <br><br>
                        If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark
                        energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and
                        energy to science and speculation.
                        <br><br>
                        Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its 
                        hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and
                        fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling 
                        into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>‘As Big as It Gets’</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach of 
                        particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first 
                        direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should 
                        ruffle space-time.
                        <br><br>
                        Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is 
                        huge, as big as it gets.”
                        <br><br>
                        He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
                        <br><br>
                        The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and 
                        preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.
                        <br><br>
                        Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic 
                        Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set 
                        of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

                        we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe 
                        has an even temperature.
                    </p>
                    <p class="nested-caption caption-2"><strong>NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong>  The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast distance 
                        from one side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix 
                        into an even temperature.
                    </p>
                    <p class="nested-caption caption-3"><strong>DISTANT COFFEE</strong>  At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one direction. 
                        You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled.
                    </p>
                    <p class="nested-caption caption-4"><strong>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</strong>  Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a similar 
                        coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction, you might 
                        want to look for another explanation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="nested-caption caption-5"><strong>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong>  There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place 
                        before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might 
                        explain their even temperature.
                    </p>
                    <p class="nested-caption caption-6"><strong>INFLATION</strong>  solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after 
                        the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually 
                        grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.
                    </p>
                    <p class="nested-caption caption-7"><strong>FLUCTUATION</strong>  Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of 
                        polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves 
                        predicted by Einstein.
                    </p>
                    <p class="nested-caption caption-8"><strong>EXPANSION</strong>  Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than light and 
                        cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth 
                        and foam of the original pot.

                        Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.
                        <br><br>
                        Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite confirmation in his 
                        lifetime.
                        <br><br>
                        “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”
                        <br><br>
                        The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email 
                        for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is 
                        now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), 
                        in his office last week.
                        <br><br>
                        “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as 
                        carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.
                        <br><br>
                        Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation, known as 
                        chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford 
                        colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him the news.
